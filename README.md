# Hello everyone.  I am a 43 year old medically retired ARMY Airborne SGT.  I returned to school to obtain my BS in Business Finance.  I know very little about writing code.  
# Right now we are working with FactSet, and all I can say is that if one has not experience with how codeing works Factset can be very difficult to use.  They also do not offer any phone support for my simple qustions.
# I am here becuase a fellow student said that GitHub is a good place to get help when it comes to coding.
